# Seasonal-Fluctuations-in-River-Networks-through-Deep-Learning-Techniques


Description:

Water Body Detection: Utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the presence of water bodies in satellite images and calculates the water level percentage.
Environmental Impact Analysis: Analyzes pairs of satellite images to determine environmental impacts such as drought, flood, or normal conditions.
Technologies Used:

Python
TensorFlow
Flask

Key Features:

Image preprocessing techniques for accurate water body detection.
Machine learning model for predicting water level percentage.
Environmental impact assessment based on comparative analysis of satellite images.
User-friendly web interface for uploading and analyzing satellite images.
Purpose:
This project aims to provide a tool for environmental monitoring and analysis using satellite imagery. It facilitates the detection of water bodies and assessment of environmental impacts, contributing to better decision-making for resource management and disaster response.The detection in the satellite images is done using the Imgae segmentation and using the masked images of the satellite images .
